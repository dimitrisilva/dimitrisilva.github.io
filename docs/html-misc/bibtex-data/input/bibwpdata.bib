  abstract = {We document the individual willingness to act against climate change and study the role of social norms in a large sample of US adults. Individual beliefs about social norms positively predict pro-climate donations, comparable in strength to universal moral values and economic preferences. However, we document systematic misperceptions of social norms. Respondents vastly underestimate the prevalence of climate-friendly behaviors and norms. Correcting these misperceptions in an experiment causally raises individual willingness to act against climate change and individual support for climate policies. The effects are strongest for individuals who are skeptical about the existence and threat of global warming.}

To establish the theoretical properties of our method, we compare it to an infeasible OLS estimator based on the knowledge of the subspaces spanned by the interactive fixed effects. We show that this OLS estimator has a sequential representation and use this result to show that it is asymptotically equivalent to the Sequential SDiD estimator. This result implies the asymptotic normality of our estimator along with corresponding efficiency guarantees. The method developed in this paper presents a natural alternative to the conventional DiD strategies in staggered adoption designs.}

At the same time, as part of the big data revolution, large, detailed, and representative, administrative data sets have become more widely available. However, the credibility of estimates of causal effects based on such data sets alone can be low. In this paper, we develop statistical methods for systematically combining experimental and observational data to obtain credible estimates of the causal effect of a binary treatment on a primary outcome that we only observe in the observational sample. Both the observational and experimental samples contain data about a treatment, observable individual characteristics, and a secondary (often short term) outcome. To estimate the effect of a treatment on the primary outcome while addressing the potential confounding in the observational sample, we propose a method that makes use of estimates of the relationship between the treatment and the secondary outcome from the experimental sample. If assignment to the treatment in the observational sample were unconfounded, we would expect the treatment effects on the secondary outcome in the two samples to be similar. We interpret differences in the estimated causal effects on the secondary outcome between the two samples as evidence of unobserved confounders in the observational sample, and develop control function methods for using those differences to adjust the estimates of the treatment effects on the primary outcome. We illustrate these ideas by combining data on class size and third grade test scores from the Project STAR experiment with observational data on class size and both third and eighth grade test scores from the New York school system.}

  abstract = {A common challenge in estimating the impact of interventions (e.g. job training programmes, educational programmes) is that many outcomes of interest (e.g. lifetime earnings or other labour market outcomes) are observed with a long delay. In biomedical settings, this is often addressed by using short-term outcomes as so-called "surrogates" for the outcome of interest, e.g. tumour size as a surrogate for mortality in cancer studies. We build on this literature by combining multiple, possibly qualitatively distinct, short-term outcomes (e.g. short-run earnings and employment indicators) systematically into a "surrogate index". Under the Prentice surrogacy assumption, which requires that the primary outcome is independent of the treatment conditional on the surrogates, we show that the average treatment effect on the surrogate index equals the treatment effect on the long-term outcome. We also relate the surrogacy assumption to a set of structural, causal assumptions. We then characterize the bias that arises from violations of each of the key assumptions, and we provide simple methods to validate these assumptions using additional observed outcomes. We apply our method to analyse the long-term impacts of a multi-site job training experiment in California. Rather than waiting a full 9 years to directly observe the long-term impact, we show that it is possible to use short-term (the first six quarters) outcomes as surrogates. Given the surrogacy assumption one could have estimated the programme's long-term impacts on mean employment rates using the employment rates observed in the first six quarters, with a 35% reduction in standard errors relative to a simple difference in means estimator based on all 9 years of data.}

Simultaneously, an increasing amount of evidence highlights that the literature strongly favors statistically significant results. I show that these two phenomena interact in a way that can substantially worsen the reliability of published estimates: while causal identification strategies alleviate bias caused by confounders, they reduce statistical power and can create another type of bias -- exaggeration -- when combined with selection on significance. This is consequential in fields such as environmental economics, as estimates turn into decision-making parameters for policy makers conducting costbenefit analyses. I characterize this confounding-exaggeration trade-off theoretically and using realistic Monte Carlo simulations replicating prevailing identification strategies and document it in an example literature. I then discuss potential avenues to address this issue.}

The most common and widely used approach to justify the PT assumption is the pre-treatment period examination. If a null hypothesis of the same trend in the outcome means for both treatment and control groups in the pre-treatment periods is rejected, researchers believe less in PT and the DID results. This paper develops a robust generalized DID method that utilizes all the information available not only from the pre-treatment periods but also from multiple data sources. Our approach interprets PT in a different way using a notion of selection bias, which enables us to generalize the standard DID estimand by defining an information set that may contain multiple pre-treatment periods or other baseline covariates. Our main assumption states that the selection bias in the post-treatment period lies within the convex hull of all selection biases in the pre-treatment periods. We provide a sufficient condition for this assumption to hold. Based on the baseline information set we construct, we provide an identified set for the ATT that always contains the true ATT under our identifying assumption, and also the standard DID estimand. We extend our proposed approach to multiple treatment periods DID settings. We propose a flexible and easy way to implement the method. Finally, we illustrate our methodology through some numerical and empirical examples.}

  abstract = {Collective action is a dynamic process where individuals in a group assess over time the benefits and costs of participating toward the success of a collective goal. Early participation improves the expectation of success and thus stimulates the subsequent participation of other individuals who might otherwise be unwilling to engage. On the other hand, a slow start can depress expectations and lead to failure for the group. Individuals have an incentive to procrastinate, not only in the hope of free riding, but also in order to observe the flow of participation by others, which allows them to better gauge whether their own participation will be useful or simply wasted. How do these phenomena affect the probability of success for a group? As the size of the group increases, will a "power of large numbers" prevail producing successful outcomes, or will a "curse of large numbers" lead to failure? In this paper, we address these questions by studying a dynamic collective action problem in which n individuals can achieve a collective goal if a share of them takes a costly action (e.g., participate in a protest, join a picket line, or sign an environmental agreement). Individuals have privately known participation costs and decide over time if and when to participate. We characterize the equilibria of this game and show that under general conditions the eventual success of collective action is necessarily probabilistic. The process starts for sure, and hence there is always a positive probability of success; however, the process "gets stuck" with positive probability, in the sense that participation stops short of the goal. Equilibrium outcomes have a simple characterization in large populations: welfare converges to either full efficiency or zero as n approaches infinity depending on a precise condition on the rate at which the share required for success converges to zero. Whether success is achievable or not, delays are always irrelevant: in the limit, success is achieved either instantly or never.}

Since top donors do not randomly support candidates, we propose an identification strategy based on information about top donors' deaths and the observed variations in candidates' performance after these events. The death of a top donor significantly decreases a candidate's chances of being elected in the current and future election cycles. Moreover, it affects the legislative activities of elected candidates. These effects do not depend on top donors' monetary contributions to a candidate but on their prominence and their total contributions during the election campaign.}

Occupying positions of authority, former slaveholders played an outsized role in this process. Beyond memorializing the Confederacy, migrants exacerbated racial violence, boosted novel forms of exclusion, and compounded Black disadvantage outside the South. Moving West, former Confederates had larger effects in frontier communities lacking established culture and institutions. Over time, they continued to transmit norms to their children and non-Southern neighbors. The diaspora legacy persists over the long run, shaping racial inequities in labor, housing, and policing. Together, our findings offer a new perspective on migration, elite influence, and the interplay between culture and institutions in the nation-building process.}

Prior to 2001, each country had similar policies, organisational structures for hospital care, and levels of resources. After 2001, the principal difference between the countries were the consequences for hospitals that failed to meet targets for waiting times: in England, failure resulted in sanctions in a process of 'naming and shaming', but in Wales, failure was perceived to result in extra resources. We use hospitals in Wales as a 'control group', to examine the effect of 'naming and shaming' in England. We found that this policy did indeed reduce waiting times in England as compared with Wales. However, there is some evidence there was in England, initially, some shuffling of prospective patients to meet specific targets which increased mean waiting times.}

For example, difference-in-differences (DID) assumes that there is no trend difference between treatment and comparison groups' untreated potential outcomes ("parallel trends"). Tests of these assumptions typically assume a null hypothesis that there is no violation. When researchers fail to reject the null, they consider the assumption to hold. We argue this approach is incorrect and frequently misleading. These tests reverse the roles of Type I and Type II error and have a high probability of missing assumption violations. Even when power is high, they may detect statistically significant violations too small to be of practical importance. We present test reformulations in a non-inferiority framework that rule out violations of model assumptions that exceed some threshold. We then focus on the parallel trends assumption, for which we propose a "one step up" method: 1) reporting treatment effect estimates from a model with a more complex trend difference than is believed to be the case and 2) testing that that the estimated treatment effect falls within a specified distance of the treatment effect from the simpler model. We show that this reduces bias while also considering power, controlling mean-squared error. Our base model also aligns power to detect a treatment effect with power to rule out meaningful violations of parallel trends. We apply our approach to 4 data sets used to analyze the Affordable Care Act's dependent coverage mandate and demonstrate that coverage gains may have been smaller than previously estimated.}

Our particular interest regards mutual communication of trustworthiness. The underlying stage-game resembles properties of a ''Continuous Prisoner's Dilemma'' with a continuous action space and the possibility of stealing the opponent's investment. The continuous investment variable corresponds to co-operation and is interpreted as individual level of trust while the defective action is interpreted as \emph{break of trust} which terminates the partnership. Players can be of two different types/discount factors. We demonstrate that there exist two distinctive extensions of the Prisoner's Dilemma to continuous action spaces differing in the incentives to invest if both parties co-operate. We then study efficient mutual communication of trustworthiness for both incentive structures in a unified framework and characterize the Pareto frontier of types' payoffs. Efficient equilibria display a typical pattern consisting of three phases. First, in the Communication Phase information about the respective opponent's type is transmitted, after which in the Adjustment Phase stakes grow over time until in the Established Phase partners behave stationary as under complete information. Efficient communication of trustworthiness takes two forms depending on incentives. We further characterize rapid trust enhancement where the adjustment phase vanishes. Efficient adjustment of stakes is governed by the impatience of the low type. There are cases where all players do strictly better than in a corresponding game with complete information. Conceptually, trust formation itself may be valuable instead of costly.}

The level and growth rate of real income per capita, social spending per capita, the degree of decentralization, and economic freedom all exert positive effects on trust. Inflation, unemployment, and debt per capita negatively affect trust. Additionally, higher levels of human capital and the elderly share of the population negatively affect trust. In the context of trust in government, the estimates suggest a heavier weight on inflation than on unemployment when compared to Okun's misery index, which weights them equally. Additionally, the estimates are used to evaluate combinations of policies, e.g. debt-financed increases in social spending that affect inflation and/or unemployment, to determine the net effect on trust in government.}

  abstract = {We consider estimation and inference of the effects of a policy in the absence of a control group. We obtain unbiased estimators of individual (heterogeneous) treatment effects and a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator of the average treatment effect. Our estimator averages over unbiased forecasts of individual counterfactuals, based on a (short) time series of pre-treatment data. The paper emphasizes the importance of focusing on forecast unbiasedness rather than accuracy when the end goal is estimation of average treatment effects. We show that simple basis function regressions ensure forecast unbiasedness for a broad class of data-generating processes for the counterfactuals, even in short panels. In contrast, model-based forecasting requires stronger assumptions and is prone to misspecification and estimation bias. We show that our method can replicate the findings of some previous empirical studies, but without using a control group.}

Thanks to the reporting requirements of online fundraising platforms first used by Democrats (ActBlue) and now Republicans (WinRed), we observe contribution-level information on the vast majority of small donations. We first show that the number of small donors (donors who do not give more than $200 to any committee during a two-year electoral cycle) and their total contributions have been growing rapidly. Second, small donors include more women and more ethnic minorities than large donors, but their geographical distribution does not differ much. Third, using a saturated fixed effects model, we find that race closeness, candidate ideological extremeness, whether candidates and donors live in the same district or state, and whether they have the same ethnicity increase contributions, with lower effects for small donors. Finally, we show that campaign TV ads affect the number and size of contributions to congressional candidates, particularly for small donors, indicating that pull factors are relevant to explain their behavior.}

I propose estimation strategies that can remove both sources of bias and semi-parametrically estimate the spillover effects themselves including in settings with staggered treatment timing. To highlight the importance of spillover effects, I revisit analyses of three place-based interventions.}

Within this general class, we consider the weights that maximize the \relevance" condition, and denote the corresponding estimand as the (Identification-) Robust Local Average Treatment Effect (RLATE). We propose estimators of the identifiable WLATEs, and establish their asymptotic normality. For a subclass that includes the RLATE, we also study the optimal bandwidth and develop bias-corrected inference. Monte Carlo simulations show that the RLATE estimator is more stable and generally has lower MSEs than the standard RDD and the RDD with covariates estimators. Finally, we implement our approach to identify the effects of cash transfers during pregnancy on the incidence of low birthweight, as in Amarante et al.

We consider the case where untreated potential outcomes may follow non-parallel trends over time across groups. This implies that the identifying assumptions of leading approaches such as difference-in-differences do not hold. We mainly focus on the case where untreated potential outcomes are generated by an interactive fixed effects model and show that variation in treatment timing provides additional moment conditions that can be used to recover a large class of target causal effect parameters. Our approach exploits the variation in treatment timing without requiring either (i) a large number of time periods or (ii) requiring any extra exclusion restrictions. This is in contrast to essentially all of the literature on interactive fixed effects models which requires at least one of these extra conditions. Rather, our approach directly applies in settings where there is variation in treatment timing. Although our main focus is on a model with interactive fixed effects, our idea of using variation in treatment timing to recover causal effect parameters is quite general and could be adapted to other settings with non-parallel trends across groups such as dynamic panel data models.}

However, the lack of formal statistical methods has led to the widespread use of ad hoc approaches in applications. Motivated by common empirical practice, we develop a unified, theoretically grounded framework for RD heterogeneity analysis. We show that a fully interacted local linear (in functional parameters) model effectively captures heterogeneity while still being tractable and interpretable in applications. The model structure holds without loss of generality for discrete covariates, while for continuous covariates our proposed (local functional linear-in-parameters) model can be potentially restrictive, but it nonetheless naturally matches standard empirical practice and offers a causal interpretation for RD applications. We establish principled bandwidth selection and robust bias-corrected inference methods to analyze heterogeneous treatment effects and test group differences.

To identify a causal effect, we exploit the fact that general suitability for service implies that how close to age 21 an individual's father happened to be at a time of war is a key determinant of the father's likelihood of participation. We find that a father's war service experience has a positive and significant effect on his son's likelihood of service. We estimate an intergenerational transmission parameter of approximately 0.1, across all wars, and that each individual war had a substantial impact on service in those that followed. We find evidence consistent with cultural transmission of war service from fathers to sons, and with the presence of substitutability between this direct transmission and oblique transmission (from society at large). In contrast, father's war service increases sons' educational achievement and actually reduces the likelihood of military service outside of wartime, suggesting that the results cannot be explained by material incentives or broader occupational choice. Taken together, our results indicate that a history of wars helps countries overcome the collective action problem of getting citizens to volunteer for war service.}

The primary setting considered here is with spatially indexed data in which the dependence structure of observed random variables is characterized by a known, observed dissimilarity measure over spatial indices. Observations are partitioned into clusters with the use of an unsupervised clustering algorithm applied to the dissimilarity measure. Once the partition into clusters is learned, a cluster-based inference procedure is applied to a statistical hypothesis testing procedure. The procedure proposed in the paper allows the number of clusters to depend on the data, which gives researchers a principled method for choosing an appropriate clustering level. The paper gives conditions under which the proposed procedure asymptotically attains correct size. A simulation study shows that the proposed procedure attains near nominal size in finite samples in a variety of statistical testing problems with dependent data.}

The high-frequency event study method regresses changes in an outcome variable on a measure of unexpected changes in a policy variable in a narrow time window around an event or a policy announcement (e.g., a 30-minute window around an FOMC announcement). We show that, contrary to popular belief, the narrow size of the window is not sufficient for identification. Rather, the population regression coefficient identifies a causal estimand when (i) the effect of the policy shock on the outcome does not depend on the other shocks (separability) and (ii) the surprise component of the news or event dominates all other shocks that are present in the event window (relative exogeneity). Technically, the latter condition requires the policy shock to have infinite variance in the event window. Under these conditions, we establish the causal meaning of the event study estimand corresponding to the regression coefficient and the consistency and asymptotic normality of the event study estimator. Notably, this standard linear regression estimator is robust to general forms of nonlinearity. We apply our results to Nakamura and Steinsson's (2018a) analysis of the real economic effects of monetary policy, providing a simple empirical procedure to analyze the extent to which the standard event study estimator adequately estimates causal effects of interest.}

We consider two distinct approaches: one based explicitly on the bivariate score variable for each unit, and the other based on their univariate distance to the boundary. For each approach, we present pointwise and uniform estimation and inference methods for the treatment effect function over the assignment boundary. Importantly, we show that methods based on univariate distance to the boundary exhibit an irreducible large misspecification bias when the assignment boundary has kinks or other irregularities, making the distance-based approach unsuitable for empirical work in those settings. In contrast, methods based on the bivariate score variable do not suffer from that drawback. We illustrate our methods with an empirical application and simulations.

Assuming that voters expect policies to be less effective if decided by women, the model predicts that female politicians undertake less containment effort than male politicians when voters perceive the threat as low, while the opposite is true when voters perceive it as serious. Exploiting Brazilian close elections, we find that, early in the pandemic, female mayors were less likely to close non-essential businesses and female-led municipalities experienced more deaths per capita, while the reverse was true later on, once the health consequences materialized.

When does propaganda reach its limit, and what are the consequences when propaganda is falsified? We study the causal effect of the Great Chinese Famine (1958-1961) on survivors' political distrust. Policy failures led to the Famine, but the propaganda blamed drought for the disaster. Information that directly contradicted the propaganda — experiences of severe Famine in the absence of abnormal drought conditions — was quasi-randomly available to some citizens, but not others. Using a nationally representative survey, we employ a difference-in-differences strategy to compare individuals who were exposed to different intensities of the Famine across regions with different levels of drought during the Famine. The Famine survivors inferred the government's liability from starvation experiences and the drought conditions, and they were more likely to dismiss the propaganda and blame the government for the Famine if they observed regular weather conditions during the Famine. As a result, these individuals expressed significantly less trust in the government. Costs of falsified propaganda are substantial, since the dampened political trust has turned into a stable political ideology. The distrust persists even half a century after the Famine, has been transmitted to the subsequent generation, and has spilled over to a broad range of political attitudes unrelated to the Famine.}

In such designs, applied work commonly analyzes each running variable separately, estimating a single-dimensional RD design in the first running variable after limiting the sample to the set of individuals qualifying on the second threshold, and vice versa. In this paper, I propose a new estimator for MRD designs using thin plate splines that improves upon the applied practice in two ways. First, the estimator can be used to estimate the conditional average treatment effect at every point on the boundary separating treated and untreated units, and second, it provides efficiency gains by using the entire sample. I also develop analogous estimators for multidimensional regression kink (MRK) and multidimensional regression discontinuity/kink designs (MRDK). I show consistency of these estimators and construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals (CIs), before presenting simulation results showing that they produce estimates and CIs that perform well in finite samples. Finally, I demonstrate the performance of my MRD estimator with two empirical applications: Londoño-Vélez, Rodríguez, and Sánchez (2020) on the effect of financial aid on college enrollment, and Keele and Titiunik (2015) on the effect of political ads on election turnout.

Our construction relies on the Riesz-Frechet representation of the target functional. Specifically, we show how the bound on the bias depends only on the additional variation that the latent variables create both in the outcome and in the Riesz representer for the parameter of interest. Moreover, in many important cases (e.g, average treatment effects and avearage derivatives) the bound is shown to depend on easily interpretable quantities that measure the explanatory power of the omitted variables. Therefore, simple plausibility judgments on the maximum explanatory power of omitted variables (in explaining treatment and outcome variation) are sufficient to place overall bounds on the size of the bias. Furthermore, we use debiased machine learning to provide flexible and efficient statistical inference on learnable components of the bounds. Finally, empirical examples demonstrate the usefulness of the approach.}

  abstract = {Two-way fixed effects (TWFE) models are widely used in political science to establish causality, but recent methodological discussions highlight their limitations under heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) and violations of the parallel trends (PT) assumption. This growing literature has introduced new estimators and diagnostics, causing confusion among researchers about the reliability of existing results and best practices. To address these concerns, we replicated and reanalyzed 49 articles from leading journals using TWFE models for observational panel data with binary treatments. Using six HTE-robust estimators, diagnostic tests, and sensitivity analyses, we find: (i) HTE-robust estimators yield qualitatively similar but highly variable results; (ii) while a few studies show clear signs of PT violations, many lack evidence to support this assumption; and (iii) many studies are underpowered when accounting for HTE and potential PT violations. We emphasize the importance of strong research designs and rigorous validation of key identifying assumptions.}

Such "interference between units" violates traditional approaches for causal inference, so that additional assumptions are often imposed to model or limit the underlying social mechanism. For binary outcomes, we propose new estimands that can be estimated without such assumptions, allowing for interval estimates that assume only the randomization of treatment. However, the causal implications of these estimands are more limited than those attainable under stronger assumptions. The estimand shows whether the treatment effects under the observed assignment varied systematically as a function of each unit's direct and indirect exposure to treatment, while also lower bounding the number of units affected.}

The Brazilian biometric electorate update offers an innovative opportunity to explore exogenous variations in abstention rates, allowing us to verify its impact on public policies, especially local public expenditures. By combining propensity score matching, differences-in-differences and instrumental variables models, we find that the electorate biometric update decreased abstention rates in local elections in Brazil, which, in turn, changed local public spending composition towards expenditures on education. The remaining categories of public expenditures explored in this study, however, seem not to be affected by the change in the electorate composition.}

Voting in partisan contests can be explained by voter's national partisanship, consistent with existing literature. However, we find that voting for local nonpartisan offices (n = 1484 contests) and ballot measures (n = 1576) is much less partisan. National partisanship explains more than 80 percent of the within-contest variation in voting for partisan state and local offices but less than 10 percent for local spending-related ballot measures. Voting for spending on roads and water are less partisan than those on education and housing, and these votes are more correlated with each other than with national partisanship.}

Our data-driven approach captures complex linguistic structures while ensuring computational scalability and economic interpretability, plausibly attaining certain advantages over and complementing other unstructured data analytics used by researchers, including emergent large language models. We conduct initial validation tests of the framework and discuss three types of its applications: (i) enhancing prediction and inference with texts, (ii) interpreting (non-text-based) models, and (iii) constructing new text-based metrics and explanatory variables. We illustrate each of these applications using examples in finance and economics such as macroeconomic forecasting from news articles, interpreting multi-factor asset pricing models from corporate filings, and measuring theme-based technology breakthroughs from patents. Finally, we provide a flexible statistical package of textual factors for online distribution to facilitate future research and applications.}

The effects are concentrated in public schools, particularly in urban areas, where poor infrastructure amplifies the impact of heat. In contrast, private schools show no significant effects, likely due to better resources, such as air conditioning. These findings highlight the need to improve learning environments, particularly in public schools, to help students cope with rising temperatures and reduce dropout rates and educational inequality.}

Consistent with this theory, we survey all the existing credibly causal studies and show that government audits seem to have positive effects mostly in middle-state-capacity environments like Brazil. We present new empirical evidence from American city governments, a high-capacity and low-impropriety environment. Using a previously unexplored threshold in federal audit rules and a dynamic regression discontinuity framework, we estimate the effects of these audits on American city finance and find no marginal effect of audits.}

We combined data of sanitation companies collected by the Brazilian government and the historical weather data from Xavier et al.

We suggest identifying conditions that are analogous to those of difference-in-differences but apply to hazard rates rather than mean outcomes. These alternative assumptions motivate estimators that retain the simplicity and transparency of standard diff-in-diff, and we suggest analogous specification tests. Our approach can be adapted to general linear restrictions between the hazard rates of different groups, motivating duration analogues of the triple differences and synthetic control methods.

I also review innovations such as the task framework developed by Acemoglu and Autor (2011). The canonical model does a surprisingly good job of predicting changes in the wage structure in the U.S. and other developed countries over the last half-century. Relative to the canonical model, the task framework adopts a more flexible view of technology and does a better job of fitting non-monotonic changes in the wage structure. Yet the task framework does not fully explain why educated workers have done so well since 1980, nor does it explain other recent facts such as flattening returns to cognitive skills and growing returns to non-cognitive, "higher-order" skills such as teamwork. To understand these recent trends, we must move beyond a single index view of human capital, toward richer, multi-dimensional frameworks. I conclude with a discussion of the nascent literature on the implications of multi-dimensional human capital for the wage structure, which raises more questions than it answers.}

We review the empirical evidence on returns to human capital from both a micro and macro perspective, as well as the evidence on returns to human capital investment over the life-cycle. We highlight two key limitations of human capital theory as currently implemented. First, prior work mostly assumes that human capital is one-dimensional and can be measured by education or test scores alone. Second, human capital is typically modeled as augmenting the marginal product of labor with workers being treated as factors of production, just like physical capital. We argue for a new approach that treats workers as agents who decide how to allocate their labor over job tasks. Traditional cognitive skills make workers more productive in any task, while higher-order skills govern workers' choices of which tasks to perform and whether to work alone or in a team. We illustrate the value of this approach with stylized models that incorporate teamwork and decision-making skills and generate predictions about how returns to skills vary across contexts.}

The method constructs a set of weights such that covariates and pre-treatment outcomes of the treated unit are approximately matched by a weighted average of control units. The weights are restricted to be nonnegative and sum to one, which allows the procedure to obtain the weights even when the number of lagged outcomes is modest relative to the number of control units, a setting that is not uncommon in applications. In the current paper we propose a more general class of synthetic control estimators that allows researchers to relax some of the restrictions in the ADH method. We allow the weights to be negative, do not necessarily restrict the sum of the weights, and allow for a permanent additive difference between the treated unit and the controls, similar to difference-in-difference procedures. The weights directly minimize the distance between the lagged outcomes for the treated and the control units, using regularization methods to deal with a potentially large number of possible control units.}

We start by reviewing the identification challenges inherent to VARMA models thereby encompassing classical and modern identification schemes and we continue along the same lines regarding estimation, specification and diagnosis of VARMA models.

We develop a method to estimate the idiosyncratic growth contribution of individual leaders (relative to their compatriots) and, drawing on Armstrong et al. (2022), calculate its uncertainty via a robust empirical Bayes confidence internal (EBCI). We show that most intuitive estimate of a leader's contribution -- the average growth rate during their tenure -- is mostly useless for measuring his or her contribution and estimating the leader effect requires major adjustments to that raw growth average. Relatively few leaders have large contributions with zero outside the 95% robust EBCI, which suggests it is difficult to identify which leaders are good or bad for growth using growth data. Although there are some leaders that stand out using our method, many of those leaders are surprises. Moreover, leaders in non-democratic countries are not much more likely to be identified as good or bad for growth than leaders in democratic ones.}

We discuss a general method to create such crosswalks: computing the share of the area of each reporting unit nested in a given reference unit. Using these shares, data can be re-aggregated from the reporting to the reference units. We apply the method to construct a crosswalk for US county-level data since 1790 to present-day counties or commuting zones.

Conditional on statistical significance, when interventions generate a 5% effect, difference-in-differences techniques overestimate the true effect by close to 100%, on average. We use data on publicly traded firms to investigate how the necessary sample size differs by context. More than 250 firms are needed to study interventions generating a 5% increase in logged revenue, while several thousand are needed to study similar increases in return on assets. Our paper shows that: i) surprisingly large sample sizes may be required to study meaningful interventions, ii) power simulations will reveal which interventions can be studied with the data at hand, and iii) power may be better for alternative measures of similar concepts.}

However, this reduces efficiency. Restricting some of these parameters to be equal (for example, subsequent treatment effects within a cohort) helps, but ad hoc restrictions may reintroduce bias. We propose a machine learning estimator with a single tuning parameter, fused extended two-way fixed effects (FETWFE), that enables automatic data-driven selection of these restrictions. We prove that under an appropriate sparsity assumption FETWFE identifies the correct restrictions with probability tending to one, which improves efficiency. We also prove the consistency, oracle property, and asymptotic normality of FETWFE for several classes of heterogeneous marginal treatment effect estimators under either conditional or marginal parallel trends, and we prove the same results for conditional average treatment effects under conditional parallel trends. We demonstrate FETWFE in simulation studies and an empirical application.}

Social norms may underpin such behavior, but they can also undermine it.

In a set of fairness games where a third party can punish unfair behavior, but players can invoke the "don't be a toad" norm, we find that the mere possibility of invoking this norm completely reverses the benefits of third-party sanctioning to achieve fair social outcomes. We establish this is an anti-social norm in a well-defined sense: most players consider it inappropriate, yet they expect the majority will invoke it. To understand this phenomenon we develop an evolutionary model of endogenous social norm transmission and demonstrate that a payoff advantage from adherence to the norm in social dilemmas, combined with sufficient heterogeneity in the disutility of those who view the norm as inappropriate, can generate the apparent paradox of an anti-social norm in the steady-state equilibrium. We provide further evidence that historical exposure to political violence, which increased the ostracization of snitches, raised sensitivity to this norm.}

Network experiments are powerful tools for this task, which avoids endogeneity by randomly assigning treatments to units over networks. However, it is non-trivial to analyze network experiments properly without imposing strong modeling assumptions. Previously, many researchers have proposed sophisticated point estimators and standard errors for causal effects under network experiments. We further show that regression-based point estimators and standard errors can have strong theoretical guarantees if the regression functions and robust standard errors are carefully specified to accommodate the interference patterns under network experiments. We first recall a well-known result that the Hajek estimator is numerically identical to the coefficient from the weighted-least-squares fit based on the inverse probability of the exposure mapping. Moreover, we demonstrate that the regression-based approach offers three notable advantages: its ease of implementation, the ability to derive standard errors through the same weighted-least-squares fit, and the capacity to integrate covariates into the analysis, thereby enhancing estimation efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the asymptotic bias of the regression-based network-robust standard errors. Recognizing that the covariance estimator can be anti-conservative, we propose an adjusted covariance estimator to improve the empirical coverage rates. Although we focus on regression-based point estimators and standard errors, our theory holds under the design-based framework, which assumes that the randomness comes solely from the design of network experiments and allows for arbitrary misspecification of the regression models.}

In this paper, I extend this literature in two ways. First, I provide some simple underlying intuition for why difference-in-differences regression does not identify a group x period average treatment effect. Second, I propose an alternative two-stage estimation framework, motivated by this intuition. In this framework, group and period effects are identified in a first stage from the sample of untreated observations, and average treatment effects are identified in a second stage by comparing treated and untreated outcomes, after removing these group and period effects. The two-stage approach is robust to treatment-effect heterogeneity under staggered adoption, and can be used to identify a host of different average treatment effect measures. It is also simple, intuitive, and easy to implement. I establish the theoretical properties of the two-stage approach and demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability using Monte-Carlo evidence and an example from the literature.}

In addition, heterogeneity tests across income quartiles show that the effect is significant only for the 3rd and 4th quartiles.

The number of groups, G, is allowed to grow but at a slower rate.

Counties where voters were enthusiastic about populist parties in the late nineteenth century had higher vote shares for Donald Trump in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. Building on the historical persistence framework, we show that counties with more individuals holding populist attitudes, racial resentment, or anti-immigration attitudes today are associated with counties voting more populist in the 1890s. Counties with strong populist voting in the past are also associated with lower net migration in subsequent periods, facilitating the persistence of these attitudes. Moments of rapid structural shifts and socioeconomic challenges may propel the resurgence of such attitudes, which can then be popularized by charismatic leaders.}

Under this far-reaching reform, educator evaluations that are used to support teacher growth and determine salary depend on a combination of supervisor evaluations, student achievement, and student or family survey responses. The reform replaced salary scales based on experience and educational attainment with those based on evaluation scores, a radical departure from decades of rigid salary schedules. The synthetic control estimates reveal positive and significant effects of the reforms on math and reading achievement that increase over time. From 2015 through 2019, the average achievement for the synthetic control district fluctuates narrowly between -0.27 s.d. and -0.3 s.d., while the Dallas ISD average increases steadily from -0.28 s.d. in 2015 to -0.08 s.d. in 2019, the final year of the sample.

For example, an excise tax on sweetened beverages in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was shown to not only be associated with a decrease in volume sales of taxed beverages in Philadelphia, but also an increase in sales in nontaxed bordering counties. The latter association may be explained by cross-border shopping behaviours of Philadelphia residents and indicate a causal effect of the tax on nearby regions, which may drastically offset the total effect of the intervention. In this paper, we adapt doubly robust difference-in-differences methodology to estimate distinct causal effects on the implementing and neighbouring control regions when they are geographically separable and data exists from an unaffected control region. Our approach adjusts for potential confounding in quasi-experimental evaluations and relaxes standard assumptions on model specification while accounting for geographically separable interference, repeated observations, spatial correlation, and unknown effect heterogeneity.

This decomposition is useful for assessing the source of identifying variation for the TWFE coefficient.

In this paper, we contribute to this literature by calculating a dissimilarity index to examine racial occupational segregation between 1980 and 2019, comparing Black and white workers with and without bachelor's degrees and by developing a Monte Carlo simulation, where we compare the observed levels of segregation to predicted levels of racial occupational segregation by education under race-neutral conditions. First, we find that considerable racial occupation segregation in the labor market persists today regardless of educational attainment and that observed segregation is substantially higher than would be expected at random, conditional on educational attainment, gender, and geography. We compare the types of occupations in which Black and white workers are disproportionately situated, and we show that this segregation has significant consequences for wage inequality between Black and white workers with and without four-year degrees. Overall, our results show that racial occupational desegregation has stalled in the past two decades despite rising educational attainment amongst Black workers.}

There has been a commendable shift toward publishing such results, either to avoid the "file drawer problem" and/or to encourage studies that conclude in favor of the null hypothesis. But how can researchers more confidently adjudicate between true, versus erroneous, nonsignificant results? Guidance on this critically important question has yet to be synthesized into a single, comprehensive text. The present essay therefore highlights seven "alternative explanations" that can lead to (erroneous) nonsignificant findings. It details how researchers can more rigorously anticipate and investigate these alternative explanations in the design and analysis stages of their studies, and also offers recommendations for subsequent studies. Researchers are thus provided with a set of strategies for better designing their experiments, and more thoroughly investigating their survey-experimental data, before concluding that a given result is indicative of "no significant effect".}

While DID removes bias from time-invariant confounders, bias from time-varying confounders may be present. Hence, like any observational comparison, DID studies remain susceptible to bias from hidden confounders. Here, we develop a method of sensitivity analysis that allows investigators to quantify the amount of bias necessary to change a study's conclusions. Our method operates within a matched design that removes bias from observed baseline covariates. We develop methods for both binary and continuous outcomes. We then apply our methods to two different empirical examples from the social sciences. In the first application, we study the effect of changes to disability payments in Germany. In the second, we re-examine whether election day registration increased turnout in Wisconsin.}

When training affects worker sorting to firms, sample selection is no longer binary but is "multilayered". This paper extends the canonical Heckman (1979) sample selection model - which assumes selection is binary - to a setting where it is multilayered, and shows that in this setting Lee bounds set identifies a total effect that combines a weighted-average of the causal effect of job training on wage rates across firms with a weighted-average of the contrast in wages between different firms for a fixed level of training. Thus, Lee bounds set identifies a policy-relevant estimand only when firms pay homogeneous wages and/or when job training does not affect worker sorting across firms. We derive sharp bounds for the causal effect of job training on wage rates at each firm which leverage information on firm-specific wages. We illustrate our partial identification approach with an empirical application to the Job Corps Study. Results show that while conventional Lee bounds are strictly positive, our within-firm bounds include 0 showing that canonical Lee bounds may be capturing a pure sorting effect of job training.}

Researchers turn to methods such as multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to improve the efficiency of estimates by partially pooling data across areas via random effects. However, the random effect approach can pool observations only through area-level aggregates. We instead propose a weighting estimator, the synthetic area estimator, which weights on variables measured only in the survey to partially pool observations individually. The proposed method consists of two-step weighting: first to adjust differences across areas and then to adjust for differences between the sample and population. Unlike MRP, our estimator can directly use the national weights that are often estimated from pollsters using proprietary information. Our approach also clarifies the assumptions needed for valid partial pooling, without imposing an outcome model. We apply the proposed method to estimate the support for immigration policies at the congressional district level in Florida. Our empirical results show that small area estimation models with insufficient covariates can mask opinion heterogeneities across districts.}

We first introduce a new measurement strategy to infer individuals' utility for parties' policy platforms from conjoint experiments. Using this measure, we find that many LDP voters in the 2017 and 2021 elections actually preferred the opposition's policies. Moreover, the LDP lost support in 2024 despite proposing a more popular set of policies. To understand what accounts for this disconnect, we experimentally manipulate party label and decompose its effect, revealing that trust appears to be an important non-policy variable behind LDP support. We interpret these findings as evidence that much of the LDP's support should be attributed to its valence advantage over the opposition, rather than voters' preferences for its policies.}

This paper develops tests for the "sharp null of full mediation" that the treatment D operates on the outcome Y only through a particular conjectured mechanism (or set of mechanisms) M. A key observation is that if D is randomly assigned and has a monotone effect on M, then D is a valid instrumental variable for the local average treatment effect (LATE) of M on Y . Existing tools for testing the validity of the LATE assumptions can thus be used to test the sharp null of full mediation when M and D are binary. We develop a more general framework that allows one to test whether the effect of D on Y is fully explained by a potentially multi-valued and multi-dimensional set of mechanisms M, allowing for relaxations of the monotonicity assumption. We further provide methods for lower-bounding the size of the alternative mechanisms when the sharp null is rejected. An advantage of our approach relative to existing tools for mediation analysis is that it does not require stringent assumptions about how M is assigned; on the other hand, our approach helps to answer different questions than traditional mediation analysis by focusing on the sharp null rather than estimating average direct and indirect effects. We illustrate the usefulness of the testable implications in two empirical applications.}

The paper studies two questions: first, how occupational licensing laws affect the distribution of quality, and second, how the effects of licensing on quality vary across regions of differing income levels. The paper uses variation in state licensing requirements for teachers and two national datasets on teacher qualifications and student outcomes from 1983-2008. Two measures of quality are used: the qualifications of candidates entering the occupation (input quality) and the quality of service provided (output quality). Results show that more restrictive licensing laws--in the form of certification tests required for initial licensure--may lead some first-year teachers of high input quality to opt out of the occupation. In the sample of teachers who remain in the occupation multiple years, stricter licensing appears to increase input quality at most quantiles of the teacher quality distribution. Output quality, as measured by student test scores, also changes with stricter occupational licensing, revealing a widening of the distribution. For most forms of licensing studied, input and output quality improvements due to stricter licensing requirements occur in high-income rather than low-income school districts.}

Our research question broadens this scope by asking what policy consequences would the treated units have experienced under counterfactual exposure settings. When we only observe treated unit(s) surrounded by controls -- as is common when a policy intervention is implemented in a single city or state -- this effect inquires about the policy effects under a counterfactual neighbourhood policy status that we do not, in actuality, observe. In this work, we extend difference-in-differences approaches to spillover settings and develop identification conditions required to evaluate policy effects in counterfactual treatment scenarios. These causal quantities are policy-relevant for designing effective policies for populations subject to various neighbourhood statuses. We develop several estimators that have desirable properties. We provide an illustrative data application to the Philadelphia beverage tax study.}

  abstract = {While external monitoring has been shown to effectively reduce missing government expenditures, its effects on public service delivery have not been credibly documented. This matters because theory is ambiguous about the effects of monitoring on downstream outcomes: since bureaucratic decisions involve multiple dimensions, deterring corruption might distort other margins, such as the quantity and quality of public goods. This paper exploits variation from an anti-corruption program in Brazil, designed by the federal government to enforce guidelines on earmarked transfers to municipalities, to study this question. Combining random audits with a differences-in-differences strategy, we find that the anti-corruption program greatly reduced occurrences of over-invoicing and off-the-record payments, and of procurement manipulation within health transfers. However, evidence from audited amounts suggests that lower corruption came at a high cost: after the program, public spending fell by so much that corruption per dollar spent may have actually increased. Health indicators, such as hospital beds and immunization coverage, became worse as a result. These findings are consistent with those responsible for procurement dramatically reducing purchases after the program, either because they no longer can capture rents, or because they are afraid of being punished for procurement mistakes.}

Using the Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) model, it is shown that one can view deterrence as a tax on (criminal) labor supply. That in turn allows an integration of a crime model with a standard public finance model. Using King et al. (1988) preferences, it is shown that when individuals are needy or desperate the income effect may dominate the substitution effect. The is that policies undertaken with the intent of deterring crime may, unintuitively, lead to an increase in crime. This provides an alternative to to Becker (1968)'s explanation for persistent crime levels. The results are also consistent with recent research showing that extending social welfare programs can reduce crime. Finally, the policy that minimizes net social costs is characterized by a combination of deterrence and transfers to reduce inequality. This result illustrates how Posner (1973)'s criteria of wealth maximization can imply that reducing inequality is a part of optimal crime policy.},

Moreover, correlation is ill-suited to this task as it is typically not justified by any economic objective. Economists' interest in interdependence often stems from complementarities (or substitutabilities) in the environment they analyze. This paper studies interdependence using supermodular objective functions: these functions treat their variables as complements, and their expectation increases as the realizations of the variables become more aligned. The supermodular ordering has a linear structure, which we exploit to obtain tractable characterizations and methods for comparing multivariate distributions, and extend when objective functions are also monotonic or symmetric. We also provide sufficient conditions for comparing random variables generated by common and idiosyncratic shocks or by heterogeneous lotteries, and illustrate our methods with several applications.}

  abstract = {How does legislature size impact public service provision? Despite the importance of institutional design for democratic governance, the effect of legislative features on citizen welfare remains little understood. In this article, we use a formal model to show that increasing legislature size improves public goods delivery. We argue that changes in bargaining costs depend on whether additional legislators share the executive's party affiliation: More opposition members reduce the equilibrium public goods provision, while more government-aligned members increase it. We test this theory by exploiting sharp discontinuities in city-council size in Brazil. We show that an additional city councilor has a 91% chance of belonging to the mayoral coalition, and this significantly improves primary school enrollment and infant mortality rates. To explore possible mechanisms, we surveyed 174 former city councilors and analyzed 346,553 bills proposed between 2005 and 2008. This article has implications for the design of representative institutions.}

Over 2 million Soviet citizens, mostly Germans and Chechens, were forcibly relocated from the western to eastern parts of the USSR during WWII solely based on ethnicity. As a result, the native population of the deportation destinations was exogenously exposed to groups with drastically different gender norms and behavior. We combine historical and contemporary data to document that present-day gender equality in labor force participation, business leadership, and fertility as well as pro-gender-equality attitudes are higher among local native population of deportation destinations with a larger presence of Protestant compared to Muslim deportees. The effects are stronger for culturally closer groups and when adopting deportee norms is less costly. The results cannot be explained by selection, vertical cultural transmission, or deportee impact on the local economy. The evidence strongly suggests that gender norms diffused horizontally from deportees to the local population through imitation and learning.}

We show that these political preferences persisted in the long run (1989-2018) when the country transitioned from a military dictatorship to a democracy. Our analysis highlights the role of immigrants' influence on the labor movement as a mechanism for transmitting values and preferences to the native population. We show that Brazilians living in municipalities with higher exposure to historical immigration are more likely to support democracy, exhibit higher levels of trust in institutions, and report preferences for redistribution.}

In this article, we consider a two-stage randomized (RAND2) p-value utilizing the uniformly most powerful (UMP) p-value in the first stage when multiple two-one-sided hypotheses are of interest. We investigate the behavior of the distribution functions of the two p-values when there are changes in the boundaries of the null or alternative hypothesis or when the chosen parameters are too close to these boundaries. We also consider the behavior of the power functions to an increase in sample size. Specifically, we investigate the level of conservativity to the sample sizes to see if we control the type I error rate when using either of the two p-values for any sample size. In multiple tests, we evaluate the performance of the two p-values in estimating the proportion of true null hypotheses. We conduct a family-wise error rate control using an adaptive Bonferroni procedure with a plug-in estimator to account for the multiplicity that arises from the multiple hypotheses under consideration. We verify the various claims in this research using simulation study and real-world data analysis.}

This happened even though the shock, implemented by a right-wing party, induced a contraction in manufacturing and formal employment in the more affected regions, and despite the left's identification with protectionist policies. To rationalize this response, we consider a new institutional channel for the political effects of trade shocks: the weakening of labor unions. We provide support for this mechanism in two steps. First, we show that union presence -- proxied by the number of workers directly employed by unions, by union density, and by the number of union establishments—declined in regions that became more exposed to foreign competition. Second, we show that the negative effect of tariff reductions on the votes for the left was driven exclusively by political parties with historical links to unions. Furthermore, the impact of the trade liberalization on the vote share of these parties was significant only in regions that had unions operating before the reform. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that tariff cuts reduced the vote share of the left partly through the weakening of labor unions. This institutional channel is fundamentally different from the individual-level responses, motivated by economic or identity concerns, that have been considered in the literature.}

Furthermore, the bounds are often regarded to be wide and less informative even under monotonicity. To address these issues, this study introduces a stochastic version of the monotonicity assumption alongside a nonparametric distributional shape constraint. The former enhances the robustness of the Lee bounds with respect to monotonicity, while the latter helps tighten these bounds. The obtained bounds do not rely on the exclusion restriction and can be root-n consistently estimable, making them practically viable. The potential usefulness of the proposed methods is illustrated by their application on experimental data from the after-school instruction programme studied by Muralidharan, Singh, and Ganimian (2019).}

They typically involve truncating the outcome variable above or below certain quantiles of its conditional distribution. In this paper, based on local linear methods, a novel, two-stage, nonparametric estimator of such functions is proposed. In this estimation problem, the conditional quantile function is a nuisance parameter that has to be estimated in the first stage. The proposed estimator is insensitive to the first-stage estimation error owing to the use of a Neyman-orthogonal moment in the second stage. This construction ensures that inference methods developed for the standard nonparametric regression can be readily adapted to conduct inference on truncated conditional expectations. As an extension, estimation with an estimated truncation quantile level is considered. The proposed estimator is applied in two empirical settings: sharp regression discontinuity designs with a manipulated running variable and randomized experiments with sample selection.}

To address the issue of multiple potential outcomes, we propose a conditional randomization method that expands on existing procedures. Our conditioning approach permits the use of treatment assignment as a conditioning variable, widening the range of application of the randomization method of inference. In addition, we propose techniques that overcome the nuisance parameter issue. We show that our resulting testing methods based on the conditioning procedure and the strategies for handling nuisance parameters are asymptotically valid. We demonstrate the testing methods using a network data set and also present the findings of a Monte Carlo study.}

This article presents an identification strategy in DiD settings with imperfect compliance that identifies Marginal treatment effects (MTE). We show how to combine and modify standard instrumental variables (IV) and DiD assumptions to identify treatment effects in DiD settings where individuals enter into treatment with at least partial knowledge of their unobservable gains. We propose two estimators for the MTE that are consistent under different assumptions regarding the functional form of potential outcomes and prove their asymptotically normality. Furthermore, we derive an estimator for the local average treatment effect (LATE) that is robust to misspecification of the MTE model. We assert the desirable finite-sample properties through simulation studies of a linear MTE model.

We also provide comprehensive tests for one of the identification assumption of the DiDC. Monte Carlo simulation studies show that the estimators have good performance in finite samples.

We leverage a new benchmark dataset providing co-located ground truth observations and remotely sensed measurements for multiple variables across the contiguous U.S. to show that the common practice of using remotely sensed measurements without correction leads to biased parameter point estimates and standard errors across a diversity of empirical settings. More than three-quarters of the 95% confidence intervals we estimate using remotely sensed measurements do not contain the true coefficient of interest. These biases result from both classical measurement error and more structured measurement error, which we find is common in machine learning based remotely sensed measurements. We show that multiple imputation, a standard statistical imputation technique so far untested in this setting, effectively reduces bias and improves statistical coverage with only minor reductions in power in both simple linear regression and panel fixed effects frameworks. Our results demonstrate that multiple imputation is a generalizable and easily implementable method for correcting parameter estimates relying on remotely sensed variables.}

In the case of balanced, between-subjects designs (perhaps controlling for pre-treatment variables), these rules are sufficient for a complete and compelling power analysis for treatment effects and interactions using only paper-and-pencil. For more complex designs, these rules can provide a useful ballpark prediction before turning to specialized software or complex simulations. Most importantly, these rules help researchers develop a sharp intuition about statistical power. For example, it can be helpful for readers and researchers to know that experiments have 80\% power to detect effects that are 2.5 times larger than the standard error and how to easily form a conservative prediction of the standard error using pilot data. These rules lower the barrier to entry for researchers new to thinking carefully about statistical power and help researchers design powerful, informative experiments.}

In our framework, treatment is determined by stochastic idiosyncratic factors, but individuals may differ in their probability of receiving treatment in ways unknown to the researcher, thus allowing for rich selection into treatment. We derive formulas for the bias of common estimators (including difference-in-means and difference-in-differences), and provide conditions under which they are unbiased for an interpretable causal estimand (e.g. analogs to the ATE or ATT). We further show that when the finite population is large, conventional standard errors are valid but typically conservative for the variance of the estimator over the randomization distribution. An interesting feature of our framework is that conventional standard errors tend to become more conservative when treatment probabilities vary more across units, i.e. when there is more selection into treatment. This conservativeness can (at least partially) mitigate undercoverage of conventional confidence intervals when the estimator is biased because of selection. Our results also have implications for the appropriate level to cluster standard errors, and for the analysis of linear covariate adjustment and instrumental variables in quasi-experimental settings.}

We show that randomization tests are often asymptotically, or approximately, valid and efficient in settings that deviate from the conditions required for finite-sample error control. When randomization tests fail to offer even asymptotic Type I error control, their asymptotic validity may be restored by constructing an asymptotically pivotal test statistic. Randomization tests can then provide exact error control for tests of highly structured hypotheses with good performance in a wider class of problems. We give a detailed overview of several prominent applications of randomization tests, including two-sample permutation tests, regression, and conformal inference.}

This difference stems from the fact that the new methods construct the pre-treatment coefficients asymmetrically from the post-treatment coefficients. As a result, visual heuristics for analyzing TWFE event-study plots should not be immediately applied to those from these methods. I conclude with practical recommendations for constructing and interpreting event-study plots when using these methods.}

Recent literature has revealed potential shortcomings of TWFE when the treatment effects are heterogeneous. Scholars have developed new advanced dynamic Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimators to tackle these potential shortcomings. However, confusion remains in applied research as to when the conventional TWFE is biased and what issues the novel estimators can and cannot address. In this study, we first provide an intuitive explanation of the problems of TWFE and elucidate the key features of the novel alternative DiD estimators. We then systematically demonstrate the conditions under which the conventional TWFE is inconsistent. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to assess the performance of dynamic DiD estimators under violations of key assumptions, which likely happens in applied cases. While the new dynamic DiD estimators offer notable advantages in capturing heterogeneous treatment effects, we show that the conventional TWFE performs generally well if the model specifies an event-time function. All estimators are equally sensitive to violations of the parallel trends assumption, anticipation effects or violations of time-varying exogeneity. Despite their advantages, the new dynamic DiD estimators tackle a very specific problem and they do not serve as a universal remedy for violations of the most critical assumptions. We finally derive, based on our simulations, recommendations for how and when to use TWFE and the new DiD estimators in applied research.}

Outcome data is thus endogenously missing for units who do not engage, in which case random or conditionally random treatment assignment prior to such choices is insufficient to point identify treatment effects. Non-parametric partial identification bounds are a way to address endogenous missingness without having to make disputable parametric assumptions. Basic bounding approaches often yield bounds that are very wide and therefore minimally informative. We present methods for narrowing non-parametric bounds on treatment effects by adjusting for potentially large numbers of covariates, working with generalized random forests. Our approach allows for agnosticism about the data-generating process and honest inference. We use a simulation study and two replication exercises to demonstrate the benefits of our approach.}

This is in large part due to its multidimensional nature, as it incorporates not only income, but also education and health. However, the low country-level resolution of the global HDI data released by the Human Development Report Office of the United Nations Development Programme (N=191 countries) has limited its use at the local level. Recent efforts used labor-intensive survey data to produce HDI estimates for first-level administrative units (e.g., states/provinces). Here, we build on recent advances in machine learning and satellite imagery to develop the first global estimates of HDI for second-level administrative units (e.g., municipalities/counties, N = 61,591) and for a global 0.1 x 0.1 degree grid (N = 806,361). To accomplish this we develop and validate a generalizable downscaling technique based on satellite imagery that allows for training and prediction with observations of arbitrary shape and size. This enables us to train a model using provincial administrative data and generate HDI estimates at the municipality and grid levels. Our results indicate that more than half of the global population was previously assigned to the incorrect HDI quintile within each country, due to aggregation bias resulting from lower resolution estimates. We also illustrate how these data can improve decision-making. We make these high resolution HDI estimates publicly available in the hope that they increase understanding of human wellbeing globally and improve the effectiveness of policies supporting sustainable development. We also make available the satellite features and software necessary to increase the spatial resolution of any other global-scale administrative data that is detectable via imagery.}

We test the diffusion hypothesis, which argues that mass emigration was delayed because it was primarily governed by a gradual process of spatial diffusion of migration networks. We propose a model of migration within a spatial network to formalize this hypothesis and to derive its testable predictions. Focusing on post-unification Italy, we construct a comprehensive municipality- and district-level panel of emigration data over four decades, and use it to show that the testable predictions of the diffusion hypothesis are validated by the data. The emerging picture is that Italian mass migration began in a few separate epicenters from which it expanded over time in an orderly pattern of spatial expansion, and that the epidemiological characteristics of this expansion match those underlying our model. These findings strongly support the diffusion hypothesis, and call for a revision of our understanding of one of the most important features of the Age of Mass Migration—the delayed migration puzzle. They also contribute to understanding the role of networks in migration beyond the context we study, showing that networks can be the main force shaping migration patterns over several decades rather than simply one factor among many.}

For the 2008 and 2010 elections, October search rates for "vote/voting", compared to four years earlier, explained 20-40 percent of state-level change in turnout rates. And out-of-sample predictions made prior to the 2012 election were strong. The data might prove useful in predicting candidate performance in midterm elections. If turnout is predicted to be high, the Democratic candidate can be expected to do better than the polls suggest. For presidential elections, the data can be useful in estimating the composition of the electorate, by comparing media market search rates to media market demographics. In the 2008 election, the Google data would have correctly predicted substantially increased African-American turnout. The out-of-sample 2012 demographics predictions using Google data were largely correct. It correctly forecast elevated Mormon turnout. It correctly forecast, contrary to some pollsters' predictions, that African-American turnout would remain elevated. Most important, perhaps, for political scientists, the Google data can be used as a dependent variable to find what determines interest in voting.}

  abstract = {Difference-in-differences designs are a powerful tool for causal inference in observational settings where typical selection-on-observables assumptions fail to hold. When a pre-treatment period is observed for all units, the treatment effect on the treated in the second period is identified non-parametrically under a weaker "parallel trends" assumption. However, researchers lack a reliable means of generalizing this approach to designs with multiple preand post-treatment periods, particularly when the parallel trends assumption only holds conditional on a set of covariates. While the two-period difference-in-differences estimator is equivalent to a fully-saturated linear regression model with unit and time dummy parameters, two-way fixed effects regression estimators do not recover the average treatment effect when there are more than two treatment periods even when parallel trends holds unless the true outcome model is correctly specified. This paper clarifies the causal estimands in a multi-period difference-in-differences design and develops an estimation strategy that extends Abadie's (2005) semiparametric inverse propensity weighting method that allows researchers to incorporate covariates without necessarily making strong assumptions about the data generating process for the outcome. It evaluates this new method on the effect of United States' investment treaties on foreign direct investment.}

TD designs augment the conventional 2x2 DiD with a "placebo" stratum -- observations that are nested in the same units and time periods but are known to be entirely unaffected by the treatment. However, many TD applications go beyond this simple 2x2x2 and use observations on many units in many "placebo" strata across multiple time periods. A popular estimator for this setting is the triple-differences regression (TDR) fixed-effects estimator -- an extension of the common "two-way fixed effects" estimator for DiD. This paper decomposes the TDR estimator into its component two-group/two-period/two-strata triple-differences and illustrates how interpreting this parameter causally in settings with arbitrary staggered adoption requires strong effect homogeneity assumptions as many placebo DiDs incorporate observations under treatment. The decomposition clarifies the implied identifying variation behind the triple-differences regression estimator and suggests researchers should be cautious when implementing these estimators in settings more complex than the 2x2x2 case. Alternative approaches that only incorporate "clean placebos" such as direct imputation of the counterfactual may be more appropriate. The paper concludes by demonstrating the utility of this imputation estimator in an application of the "gravity model" to the estimation of the effect of the WTO/GATT on international trade.}

For municipalities initially spending below the 15% threshold, we find (a) large increases in health spending specifically, driven by administrative spending, infrastructure investment, and human resources; (b) a resulting greater supply of personnel, primary care coverage, and municipal hospitals; and (c) reductions in infant mortality rates, in particular for deaths during the neonatal period. While we find substantial cost increases and lower mortality elasticities compared with previous correlational parameters, benefits still exceed costs provided any VSL greater than US$764 thousand.

Furthermore, the usual parallel trends test is invalid, meaning one may find pre-trends when the parallel trends assumption holds, and vice versa. We discuss two solutions. First, we show that including a linear term trend will recover the ATT if the differences in trends are constant over time (both in unequal baseline and canonical DiD settings) but not otherwise. Second, estimation in reverse also recovers the ATT if the potential outcomes do not depend on past treatments and post-policy statuses are converging.}

I test this theory through a causal event study of state prosecutors in Brazil, leveraging administrative data on their deployment and behavior across municipalities. I find that prosecutorial presence causes increased anti-corruption action targeted at the local government. In response to prosecutor presence, local politicians hire more bureaucrats in the civil service, rather than on temporary contracts -- a common vehicle for corruption in this setting. I combine these quasi-experimental findings with insights from a survey of politicians and in-depth interviews with prosecutors. Together, the results suggest that physical presence can make prosecutors more effective at fighting corruption and provide rare causal evidence of the impact of prosecutor's offices on local governance outcomes.}

Such spatial spillover effects violate the standard "no interference" assumption for standard causal inference methods. The complexity of spatial spillover effects also raises the risk of misspecification and bias in model-based analyses. We offer an approach for robust inference in such settings without having to specify a parametric outcome model. We define a spatial "average marginalized effect" (AME) that characterizes how, in expectation, units of observation that are a specified distance from an intervention location are affected by treatment at that location, averaging over effects emanating from other intervention nodes. We show that randomization is sufficient for non-parametric identification of the AME even if the nature of interference is unknown. Under mild restrictions on the extent of interference, we establish asymptotic distributions of estimators and provide methods for both sample-theoretic and randomization-based inference. We show conditions under which the AME recovers a structural effect. We illustrate our approach with a simulation study. Then we re-analyze a randomized field experiment and a quasi-experiment on forest conservation, showing how our approach offers robust inference on policy-relevant spillover effects.}

The concept is defined for infinite games, strengthening the foundation of PBE in settings where sequential equilibrium is not defined. Implications of plain consistency are worked out, including the relation to subgame perfection, a version of "no signaling what you don't know", and the structure of beliefs in a wide class of sender/designer games.

Scholars exploit the staggered roll-out of policies like election regulation, civil service reform, and healthcare across places to estimate causal effects - often using the two-way fixed effects (TWFE) estimator.

In response, scholars have increasingly turned to modern DID estimators that promise greater robustness to real-world data problems. This paper asks how well these modern methods work for for the empirical settings and sample sizes commonly used in political science, with the U.S. states as the running example. In particular, it provides a simulation study of the performance of seven DID methods under either constant or heterogeneous effects, in an N = 50 setting that mimics the American federalism natural experiment. I find that many modern methods (1) produce confidence intervals that do not include the true average effect at the specified rate and (2) are underpowered. I show that many cases of coverage problems with modern DID estimators can be addressed using the block bootstrap to estimate standard errors. However, I also show that even where identification and estimation are straightforward, the fifty-state sample poses a power problem without large average effect sizes -- at least 0.5 standard deviations. I illustrate the challenges of DID research with the fifty-state panel in the case of estimating the effects of strict voter identification laws on voter turnout.}

  abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of a "trimmed aggregate ATT", which is a weighted average of a set of group-time average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) parameters identified in a staggered adoption difference-in-differences (DID) design. The set of identified group-time ATTs that contribute to the aggregate is trimmed to achieve compositional balance across an event window, ensuring that comparisons of the aggregate parameter over event time reveal dynamic treatment effects and differential pre-trends rather than compositional changes. Taking the trimmed aggregate ATT as a target parameter, we investigate the performance of stacked DID estimators. We show that the most basic stacked estimator does not identify the target aggregate or any other average causal effect because it applies different implicit weights to treatment and control trends. The bias can be eliminated using corrective sample weights. We present a weighted stacked DID estimator, and show that it correctly identifies the target aggregate, providing justification for using the estimator in applied work.}

  abstract = {I establish the equivalence between the two-way fixed effects (TWFE) estimator and an estimator obtained from a pooled ordinary least squares regression that includes unit-specific time averages and time-period specific cross-sectional averages, which I call the two-way Mundlak (TWM) regression. This equivalence furthers our understanding of the anatomy of TWFE, and has several applications. The equivalence between TWFE and TWM implies that various estimators used for intervention analysis – with a common entry time into treatment or staggered entry, with or without covariates – can be computed using TWFE or pooled OLS regressions that control for time-constant treatment intensities, covariates, and interactions between them. The approach allows considerable heterogeneity in treatment effects across treatment intensity, calendar time, and covariates. The equivalence implies that standard strategies for heterogeneous trends are available to relax the common trends assumption. Further, the two-way Mundlak regression is easily adapted to nonlinear models such as exponential models and logit and probit models.}

I start by clarifying two identification regimes for TSCS analysis: one under the strict exogeneity assumption and one under the sequential ignorability assumption. I then review three most commonly used methods by political scientists: the difference-in-differences approach, two-way fixed effects models, and the synthetic control method. For each method, I examine its assumptions, explain its pros and cons, and discuss its extensions. I then introduce several new methods under strict exogeneity or sequential ignorability, including the factor-augmented approach, PanelMatch, and marginal structural models. Finally, I conclude by providing some recommendations to applied researchers and pointing out several directions for future research.}

  abstract = {In many scenarios, such as the evaluation of place-based policies, potential outcomes are not only dependent upon the unit's own treatment but also its neighbors' treatment. Despite this, "difference-in-differences" (DID) type estimators typically ignore such interference among neighbors. I show in this paper that the canonical DID estimators generally fail to identify interesting causal effects in the presence of neighborhood interference. To incorporate interference structure into DID estimation, I propose doubly robust estimators for the direct average treatment effect on the treated as well as the average spillover effects under a modified parallel trends assumption. The approach in this paper relaxes common restrictions in the literature, such as partial interference and correctly specified spillover functions. Moreover, robust inference is discussed based on the asymptotic distribution of the proposed estimators.}

For a measurement error of the binary treatment, the standard estimator is inconsistent for the causal parameter. To solve the problem, we develop a local linear generalized method of moments inference by using the availability of an exogenous variable. We then develop identification with a nonclassical measurement error for the assignment variable without additional information. We show that when some compliers accurately report their assignment values, the standard estimand may identify a meaningful causal parameter for them.}

It is generally difficult to estimate treatment parameters defined with the potential outcome given the entire path of treatment adoption, because each treatment path may be experienced by only a small number of observations. We propose an alternative approach using the concept of effective treatment, which summarizes the treatment path into an empirically tractable low-dimensional variable, and develop doubly robust identification, estimation, and inference methods.}

  abstract = {Precise measurement of the forcing variable in regression discontinuity designs is critical to precise evaluation of treatment effects. Such evaluation can be sensitive to measurement errors, which are prevalent in many applications of regression discontinuity designs. The present paper studies identification of treatment effects using local polynomial estimation in the presence of measurement error. The main findings are as follows. In sharp designs, when the measurement error is fixed, the treatment effect can be identified in some special cases if the treatment is based on the contaminated forcing variable, but cannot be identified if the treatment is based on the error free forcing variable. If the measurement error is local to zero, the treatment effect can be identified with a small extra bias and without efficiency loss if the treatment is based on the contaminated forcing variable; the treatment effect can be identified with efficiency loss and a large bias if the treatment is based on the error free forcing variable and the treatment status can be observed; the treatment effect cannot be identified if the treatment is based on the error free forcing variable and the treatment status cannot be observed unless the measurement error is extremely small. The results are extended to fuzzy designs. Monte Carlo results confirm the theoretical analysis.}

  abstract = {In an empirical study of persuasion, researchers often use a binary instrument to encourage individuals to consume information and take some action. We show that, with a binary Imbens-Angrist instrumental variable model and the monotone treatment response assumption, it is possible to identify the joint distribution of potential outcomes among compliers. This is necessary to identify the percentage of mobilized voters and their statistical characteristic defined by the moments of the joint distribution of treatment and covariates. Specifically, we develop a method that enables researchers to identify the statistical characteristic of persuasion types: always-voters, never-voters, and mobilized voters among compliers. These findings extend Abadie’s kappa theorem. We also provide a sharp test for the two sets of identification assumptions. The test boils down to testing whether there exists a non-negative solution to a possibly underdetermined system of linear equations with known coefficients. We apply these results to a voter mobilization experiment.}

  abstract = {This paper extends difference-in-differences (DiD) to settings with continuous treatments. Specifically, the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) at any level of treatment intensity is identified under a conditional parallel trends assumption. Estimating the ATT in this framework requires first estimating infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters, particularly the conditional density of the continuous treatment, which can introduce substantial bias. To address this challenge, we propose estimators for the causal parameters under the double/debiased machine learning framework and establish their asymptotic normality. Additionally, we provide consistent variance estimators and construct uniform confidence bands based on a multiplier bootstrap procedure. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we revisit a previous study on the 1983 Medicare Prospective Payment System reform, reframing it as a DiD with continuous treatment and non-parametrically estimating its effects.}
