I would like to create a self-study plan on static optimization for economists and would appreciate your help in designing such a plan based on a couple of textbooks of my choice.

I intend to study Chapters 1 through 8 of Sundaram's *A First Course in Optimization Theory* and Chapters 4 through 5 of Corbae, Stinchcombe, and Zeman's *An Introduction to Mathematical Analysis for Economic Theory and Econometrics*. All material contained in the specified chapters of the reference materials should be included in the study plan. However, since there is overlap between the two texbooks, I would like the study plan to place greater emphasis on the material from Corbae, Stinchcombe, and Zeman.

Please create a study plan that satisfies the following requirements:

- The plan must be divided into modules, where the content of modules are defined more by topic than the time it takes to study the content.
- At the beginning of each module, include a one-paragraph overview explaining what will be learned and why the material is important for what follows.
- For each module, indicate:
  - the primary source (the reference providing the most detailed exposition), and
  - the secondary source (the reference providing a more concise or complementary treatment),
  specifying the relevant sections from each reference.
- Indicate any prerequisite material that appears earlier in the listed references content.
- Identify concepts (e.g., definitions) and results (e.g., lemmas, propositions, theorems) that are not required for understanding subsequent modules and may be safely skipped.
- Suggest any exercise from the specified chapters or sections whose content is not proved by any of the reference materials and whose result is used to prove results that follow.
- Each module should be detailed enough to guide self-paced study, with specific steps or sub-tasks for each section.
- The study plan should build logically from one module to the next, with clear connections drawn between them. If there is overlap between the two textbooks, please indicate which concepts will be emphasized in each source.
- As chapters 1 through 3 of Corbae et al.'s textbook is not included in the study plan, there should be a small piece of text--made of a couple of paragraphs--indicating the minimally necessary set of sections and concepts from those chapters that students must be familiar with to be able understand the content of the study plan.

I have attached the textbooks so you can precisely consult the material. Please write the study plan in the style of a course syllabus. At the end of the study plan, please include a summary table in which the first column lists the modules and the remaining columns correspond to each textbook. Each cell should indicate the chapters or sections of the relevant textbook covered in that module.

Skipping Chapters 6 through 9 will hinder the understanding of Chapter 10. While Chapter 10 directly builds on the finite-dimensional convex analysis from Chapter 5, it extends those ideas to infinite-dimensional settings using more general topological vector spaces. This requires familiarity with concepts that are developed in the intervening chapters, including general metric spaces (beyond the finite-dimensional case in Chapter 4), measure theory, normed vector spaces like \(L^p\), and some aspects of probabilities on metric spaces. The book's preface emphasizes a unified approach via the metric completion theorem (introduced in Chapter 6), and Chapter 10 explicitly references material from Chapters 8 and 9 while assuming knowledge from Chapters 6 and 7.

Assuming you've already studied Chapters 1–5, here are the essential sections from Chapters 6–9 needed for Chapter 10. These provide the foundational tools (e.g., topologies from metrics, completeness, Banach spaces, and duals) without which Chapter 10's discussions of non-metric topologies, separation, and fixed points in infinite dimensions will be difficult to follow. Focus on the core definitions, theorems, and proofs in these sections, skipping economic examples if time is limited.

### From Chapter 6 (Metric Spaces)
This chapter generalizes the finite-dimensional metrics from Chapter 4 to arbitrary metric spaces, which Chapter 10 treats as a special case of topological spaces. Key for understanding completeness, continuous functions, and spaces like \(C(M)\).
- 6.1: The Space of Compact Sets and the Theorem of the Maximum (builds on compactness from Chapter 4).
- 6.2: Spaces of Continuous Functions (essential for bounded continuous functions and uniform norms).
- 6.7: Defining Functions Implicitly and by Extension (covers implicit function theorems in general spaces).
- 6.8: The Metric Completion Theorem (core to the book's unified approach; directly referenced in the preface as bridging rationals to reals and fields to measures).

### From Chapter 7 (Measure Spaces and Probability)
Measure theory is prerequisite for the \(L^p\) spaces in Chapter 8, which serve as key examples of infinite-dimensional normed spaces in Chapter 10.
- 7.1: The Basics of Measure Theory (defines measures, \(\sigma\)-fields, and measurable functions).
- 7.2: Four Limit Results (monotone convergence, fatou's lemma, etc., for handling limits in integrals).
- 7.3: Good Sets Arguments and Measurability (techniques for proving measurability).
- 7.5: Dominated Convergence, Uniform Integrability, and Continuity of the Integral (key for integration in normed spaces).

### From Chapter 8 (The \(L^p(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)\) and \(\ell^p\) Spaces, \(p \in [1, \infty]\))
Directly referenced in Chapter 10 as the setting where convexity reappears in infinite dimensions. Provides examples of Banach spaces and duals.
- 8.3: The Basics of \(L^p(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)\) and \(\ell^p\) (norms, completeness, and basic properties).
- 8.5: Signed Measures, Vector Measures, and Densities (links measures to vector spaces).
- 8.8: Dual Spaces: Representations and Separation (Hahn-Banach in normed spaces; central to Chapter 10's generalizations).

### From Chapter 9 (Probabilities on Metric Spaces)
Referenced in Chapter 10 for tying continuous functions to probabilities. Less critical than Chapters 6–8, but useful for understanding representations and compactness in probability spaces.
- 9.3: The Metric Space \((\Delta(M), \rho)\) (probabilities as a metric space).
- 9.6: The Riesz Representation Theorem for \(\Delta(M)\), \(M\) Compact (links functionals to measures).
- 9.8: The Riesz Representation Theorem for Polish Metric Spaces (extends to non-compact cases).
- 9.9: Compactness in \(\Delta(M)\) (tightness and Prokhorov's theorem for compact subsets).
